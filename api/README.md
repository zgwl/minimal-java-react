- (Optional) [Spring Initializr Java Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr) for quickly initializing a new Java Spring project. You could also use the [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/) to manually initialize the project.

Enable Java Auto Import in VS Code setting by searching "java import save" in the VS Code setting page.
